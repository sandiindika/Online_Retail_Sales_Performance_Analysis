# Data-Analysis

Data Science Projects Using Python.

Data Analysis is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data.

This repository is a place to share my code and notebooks for numerous data science projects.

Many of these projects are written up on my Portfolio Website page.

You can get the data at this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWbSRhad77tiphkIJY2x6ISl8pKhK-V6/view?usp=sharing">link</a>. I didn't list it in this repository because it's too big
